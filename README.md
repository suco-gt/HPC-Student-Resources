# GT HPC Student Resources

At GT Supercomputing, one of our major goals is to offer awareness on opportunities in HPC. This document is intended as a fully-fledged guide on all opportunities related to HPC at GT, including internship & fellowship opportunities, professors at GT, classes at GT, conferences in HPC, and more!
Please note that this document is **not** complete, and we are constantly adding new opportunities to this list! 

If you find any other opportunities from outside this document, feel free to make a pull request or let us know at supercomputing.gt@gmail.com.

### HPC Internship and Fellowship Opportunities
To find internship and fellowship opportunities in HPC, please refer to this [link](https://github.com/suco-gt/HPC-Internships), which contains a list of many opportunities in industry & academic settings for becoming involved in HPC. 

### GT Vertically Integrated Projects (VIPs)
At GT, Vertically Integrated Projects (VIPs) are intended to give students hands-on experiences in different areas of computing. Some of the VIPs that involve HPC are listed below.

### GT Faculty Researchers
Getting involved in HPC research is one of the best ways to get hands-on experience in HPC. Here, we've listed some professors who work on many different aspects of HPC research at GT. (NotE: We are still in the process of adding to this list as there are a lot of professors who use supercomputing clusters to aid their research efforts.)

### HPC Conferences
Many of the members of GT Supercomputing have had extremely positive experiences at various HPC conferences, which give students a chance to network, learn about research, and potentially find new opportunities in HPC. We encourage students interested in HPC to attend these conferences if at possible, whether they are presenting research or simply attending.
